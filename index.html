      Rihanna was born February 20, 1988, and is a Barbadian singer, actress, and businesswoman.
      Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, Barbados, Rihanna
      auditioned for American record producer Evan Rogers who invited her to the
      United States to record demo tapes. After signing with Def Jam in 2005,
      she soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio
      albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006), both of which
      were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US
      Billboard 200 chart.
